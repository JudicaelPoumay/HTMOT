# HTMOT
This repo contains the survey & demo for the paper HTMOT : Hierarchical Topic Modelling Over Time

# DEMO
Here is the link to the demo https://www.hec.uliege.be/static/demo/JS.html

You can double click on a topic to see its sub-topics. 
Only topics with dotted border have sub-topics.
Beware that there is a display glitch where sub-topics may not be aligned with parent topic.

A single click will select a topic which brings more information about it in the upper right corner.
The upper right corner can be expended to show info such as the time distribution of that topic, words, entities, top documents, ...

The buttons [>>> number] are part of another paper about topic tracking

On the top right you can also switch between two periods 2019 & 2020
